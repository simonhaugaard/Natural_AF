community	2019-07-22			1.1.0	These reference intergenic sequences have not been generated by Bgee. Use with caution.	Release allowing to access to all reference intergenic sequences generated by the community and not present in Bgee for the moment.
custom	2019-07-22			1.1.0	You decided to use your own reference intergenic sequences	Release allowing to use your own FASTA reference intergenic sequences. When this release is selected BgeeCall will use the sequences at UserMetadata@custom_intergenic_path to generate present/absent calls.
